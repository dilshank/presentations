Welcome to MaptimeOAK on geocoding: 12 November 2015

Rhonda Glennon, Mapzen, `@rmglennon`

## Agenda

- Basics of geocoding
- Examples and how you are using it
- Tools you can use for geocoding
- Hands-on tutorial: Add Mapzen Search box to a Leaflet map

## Basics and definitions

- geocoding - the process of converting an address or the name of a landmark or business into a latitude, longitude pair. Sometimes referred to as forward geocoding.
- reverse geocoding - the process of converting a latitude, longitude pair into the name and address of the nearest place.

## Examples of geocoding

- Search boxes on a map
- Address search boxes for hotels
- Autocomplete for addresses on an order form
- Suggestions for meeting locations on a calendar
- Routing between locations
- Tap a location on a map and get the business name or address (reverse geocoding)

## Tools for batch geocoding (upload a CSV)

- [CartoDB Academy Account](https://cartodb.com/signup?plan=academy) - geocoding credits and free space
- [csvgeocode](https://github.com/veltman/csvgeocode) - geocode a CSV into [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/geocoding/), [OSM Nominatim](http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/), [Mapzen](https://mapzen.com/projects/search), and [Texas A & M's](http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/WebService/) geocoders.
- [GeoCodio](http://geocod.io/) - geocoding as a service
- [Google Fusion Tables](http://mappingmashups.net/2012/11/29/mapping-with-google-fusion-tables/) - tutorial from MaptimeOAK
- [Esri ArcGIS Online](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html) - can geocode about 250 points with a free/public account

## Hands-on tutorial

You will learn how to make a map with a search box that allows you to enter addresses and place names and locate them on a map. By the end of the night, everyone will have built a searchable web map!

Follow along with the group, or work ahead on your own!
