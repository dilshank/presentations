# Make maps more interactive with the magic of a geocoding search box

Interactive maps are everywhere these days, and geocoding powers the interactive map experience. Geocoding turns addresses and place names into geographic coordinates. With coordinates of places revealed, the map can pan and zoom to the right location, drop markers, and draw outlines of geographic areas. In this workshop, you’ll be learning how to build an interactive map that contains a simple, yet powerful, search box powered by the Mapzen Search API, which is an open-source geocoding service built on open data sets, including OpenStreetMap.

In this hands-on session, you’ll learn:

- An overview of geocoding and examples of it
- How you can use OpenStreetMap for geocoding
- What tools are available for geocoding
- How build a simple web page containing a map through the Leaflet JavaScript library
- How to add the Mapzen Search geocoding plug-in to your map
- Options for customizing the geocoder and improving search results
- How to link the geocoder results into other tools, such as a routing or navigation

Bring your laptop! This session is appropriate for all levels of web programming or geocoding experience. The goal is for all attendees to leave with a web page containing a map and a working geocoding search box on it.
