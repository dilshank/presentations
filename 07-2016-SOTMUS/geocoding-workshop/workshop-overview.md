# Make maps more interactive with the magic of a geocoding search box

Facilitators: Rhonda Glennon, Katie Kowalsky, Diana Shkolnikov - [Mapzen](https://mapzen.com/)

## Agenda

- Welcome and introductions
- Get ready for the tutorial: install a text editor
- Basics of geocoding
- Discussion on how you are using geocoding
- Hands-on tutorial: Make an interactive map with Mapzen Search (most of the workshop is here)

## Get ready for the tutorial

To work through the tutorial, you need a text editor, an Internet connection, and a modern browser. All the source code is provided for you.

While you can use the text editor apps installed with your operating system, such as Notepad or TextEdit, they do not provide the helpful indentations, code coloring and autocomplete, or text alignment options found in the other editors.

Example text editors:

- [Atom - OS X, Windows, Linux](https://atom.io/)
- [Notepad++ - Windows](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- [TextWrangler - OS X](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)
- [Sublime - OS X, Windows, Linux; free trial](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

For TextEdit, you must go to the Format menu and click Make Plain Text to use the plain-text version of the file. Do not use an app that applies rich formatting, such as Word or Wordpad.

## Basics

Geocoding turns addresses and place names into geographic coordinates for mapping. Geocoding is one of the essential tools you need to put points on maps and power routing and navigation. When you type in an address or landmark in to your phone, a geocoding process converts those words into coordinates and displays the search result on your map.

### Examples of geocoding

- Search boxes on a map
- Address search boxes for hotels
- Autocomplete for addresses on an order form
- Suggestions for meeting locations on a calendar
- Routing between locations
- Tap a location on a map and get the business name or address (reverse geocoding)
- What are some other examples you use?

## Hands-on tutorial with Mapzen Search

[Mapzen Search](https://mapzen.com/projects/search) is a modern, geographic search service based on open-source tools and open data. You will learn how to make a map with a search box that allows you to enter addresses and place names and locate them on a map. By the end of the workshop, everyone will have built a searchable web map!

Follow along with the group, or work ahead on your own.
