## [Extracting interesting data from OSM](mapzen/presentations/06-2015-SOTMUS/ExtractingInterestingThingsWorkshop-Indy-Diana.pdf)
#### Diana Shkolnikov and Indy Hurt

OSM data is HUGE! Its vastness presents a significant challenge to anyone wanting to extract a meaningful subset of the data. The challenges this presents are twofold. First, how does one figure out what OSM contains that might be of interest. Second, how does one go about extracting that awesome, meaningful, super important data.

This workshop will walk participants through browsing OSM data using taginfo to identify potentially interesting items. Once a meaningful subset of the data has been targeted, the focus will switch to extracting that data. Various available tools will be examined, such as osmfilter, osmium, fences, etc. The group will perform a simple polygon extraction using fences, which is an administrative boundary extraction tool for OSM.

Finally, the participants will work on a simple visualization of the shiny new extracted data. Participants should walk away with a good grasp on some simple and powerful tools for working with OSM data to create and visualize their own custom datasets.
